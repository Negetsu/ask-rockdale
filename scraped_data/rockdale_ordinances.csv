 care and control evidencing advanced symptoms of contagious, infectious or fatal diseases,
 is seriously ill or severely injured, animal care and control shall seek the services

(a)
The board of commissioners does hereby find that:
(1)
Certain studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air
 pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy non-smokers,
 including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer.
(2)
Certain studies have also found that secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to
 elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired
 respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive disease. Children
 exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections,
 sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer.
(b)
Accordingly, the board of commissioners finds and declares that the purposes of this
 article are to:
(1)
Protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and
 private places of employment; and
(2)
Provide to non-smokers the opportunity to breathe 100 percent smoke-free air in all
 public places and private places of employment; and
(3)
Recognize that the need to breathe 100 percent smoke-free air shall have priority
 over the desire to smoke.

(a)
Shared parking may be permitted by the director if the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates
 that the actual peak parking requirements of the proposed development or use can be
 satisfied with a lesser number of parking spaces through sharing adjacent parking
 for two or more proximate uses because peak demand periods for proposed land uses
 do not occur at the same time periods.
(b)
Developers requesting reductions based on shared parking shall submit the following
 to the director for review at the time of submitting a preliminary plat or site development
 plan for the project:
(1)
Site plan indicating the location of uses proposing to share parking requirements
 and design of shared parking facilities.
(2)
Names and addresses of the owner(s) and uses that share parking.
(3)
Location and number of parking shared spaces.
(4)
If there is more than one owner, submit a cross-access legal agreement between owners
 to assure the continued availability of adequate parking.
(5)
A shared parking analysis that shall follow the procedures detailed in the paragraph
 below.
(c)
The procedures for determining parking requirements in a mixed use development are:
(1)
Determine the minimum amount of parking required for each separate use described in
 the table of minimum parking requirements.
(2)
Multiply the parking requirement for each use by the corresponding percentage for
 each of the time periods in the table of parking ratios by use and time of day for
 mixed-use developments.
(3)
Sum the total parking requirements for all uses for each of the five time periods
 in the table of parking ratios by use and time of day for mixed-use developments.
(4)
The parking requirement for the time period having the largest required total number
 of parking spaces based on use of table of parking ratios by use and time of day for
 mixed-use developments shall be the minimum required number of parking spaces for
 the mixed-use development.

(d)
Any subsequent change in land uses within the participating developments shall require
 proof that adequate parking will be available. Prior to any change in ownership or
 use, the owner must apply to the director for an evaluation and confirmation of the
 reduction. If the director finds that the parking reduction is no longer justified,
 the director shall notify the owner to construct the number of parking spaces necessary
 to meet the required level.
(e)
On-street parking.
Up to 50 percent of the on-street parking spaces available within 600 feet of a use
 may be counted towards the minimum off-street parking requirements, provided that
 the same parking space cannot be used to contribute to the off-street parking requirements
 of by more than one parcel. No more than 25 percent of the number of required off-street
 parking spaces may be provided by on-street parking.
(f)
Administrative variance.
The director shall have the authority to grant a reduction in the total number of
 off-street parking spaces by up to 20 percent of the number required by the table
 of minimum parking requirements through administrative variance. Such administrative
 variance requires review and approval of the applicant's written documentation and
 justification that one or more of the following conditions exist:
(1)
Because of unique circumstances including the shape, topography, soils and vegetation
 of the site, the provision of the minimum number of required spaces would cause the
 applicant to suffer unique and undue hardship.
(2)
The site is located in an environmentally sensitive area, such as a water supply watershed,
 where stormwater runoff should be minimized.
(3)
The unique circumstances of the use make the minimum number of parking spaces excessive
 for actual needs.
(g)
Landscaped reserve.
Where it can be demonstrated that a use or establishment will temporarily need a
 lesser number of parking spaces than is required (such as phased occupancy of large
 new facilities or eventual succession of a new use), the number of such spaces required
 may be reduced by not more than 50 percent, subject to the site plan approval, provided
 that the following requirements are met:
(1)
The applicant shall submit documentary evidence to the planning and development director
 that the use will temporarily justify a lesser number of spaces for a period of time
 not less than one year.
(2)
A reserve area provided shall be sufficient to accommodate the difference between
 the spaces required and the lesser number provided. Said reserve area shall:
a.
Be inclusive of all associated parking spaces, drive aisles, access routes, transition
 slopes, and infrastructure.
b.
Not encroach upon or directly drain to any water body, wetland, undisturbed buffer,
 impervious setback, floodplain, or other environmentally sensitive area.
(3)
Said reserved area shall be maintained exclusively as landscaped area and shall be
 clearly indicated as ""Reserve Parking Area"" on the site plan.
(4)
The landscaping may either consist of existing natural vegetation or be developed
 as a new landscaped area, whichever is granted site plan approval.
(5)
No structure, mechanical equipment, material stockpile, or trash may be placed in
 the landscaped reserve; and no parking shall be allowed within the landscaped reserve
 until developed as a parking lot.
(6)
Said reserve area shall not be counted toward the minimum open space required by lot
 coverage provisions of this section.
(7)
When in the opinion of the planning director additional parking is required, said
 reserve area may be required to be developed as a parking lot.
(8)
A separate land disturbance permit shall be required for any modification to the reserve
 area regarding its location, size, use, configuration, or impervious coverage.

 groundwater being stored in the overlying soils. The significant recharge areas are
 those with thicker soils. Field mapping indicates that thick soils in the Piedmont
 and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of two or more geologic contacts per
 four squares miles (source: 1976 1:500,000 Geologic Map of Georgia) and slopes lower
 than eight percent.
(3)

(a)
The uses set forth in the table below shall be permitted only as listed within each
 zoning district and only in the manner so listed. Any use not listed in said table
 is prohibited in all districts. No use shall be permitted and no structure associated
 with such use shall be erected, structurally altered or enlarged unless the use is
 permitted as one of the following:
(1)
P: A permitted use.
(2)
C: A use requiring a special use permit subject to approval following the application
 procedures and requirements in section [chapter] 238 of the UDO.
(3)
S: A supportive commercial use that is on the same lot or parcel with a permitted
 use in a zoning district and established for the sole convenience of nearby residents,
 employees, patients, patrons or visitors within walking distance.
(4)
A: An accessory use subject to the requirements specified and generally applicable
 to accessory uses.
(b)
Any use not listed with the letter P, C, S, or A in a particular zoning district shall
 be prohibited in that zoning district, unless it is a nonconforming use lawfully established
 prior to the effective date of the regulation that rendered it legally nonconforming.
 See [chapter] section 234.
(c)
Any use listed with a ""Yes"" in the column headed by the words ""Suppl. Reg?"" in the
 table below shall satisfy the applicable supplemental use standards established in
section 218-13
of this chapter, in addition to the development regulations of the district in which
 it is located.
(d)

 are provided in
section 218-24
.
(e)

section 206-2
.
(f)
The majority of uses listed in the table below are based on the North American Industry

 and where the use has a NAICS code indicated in the table below, the NAICS definition
 shall apply. For uses that fall within more than one use category, the more detailed
 definition shall apply (the definition of a six-digit NAICS class usurps the definition
 of a five-digit NAICS class, the definition of a five-digit NAICS class usurps the
 definition of a four-digit NAICS class and so on). All remaining uses identified in

 fully and clearly delineated on a map, which shall be no smaller than 8½ × 11 inches
 in size, and attached to the application for a permit. All public streets and/or sidewalks
 within and adjacent to such area(s) shall be clearly identified. The department shall

of the Rockdale County Code of Ordinances.
(d)
Vendors.
(1)
Sales permitted.
The sale of food or any merchandise or services of any type by a vendor shall be

 shall be conducted in accordance with such conditions and limitations as shall be
 imposed in writing by the permit holder and submitted as part of the application for
 a permit. Vending on private property is prohibited. Beer, wine and liquor sales,
 service and consumption shall be prohibited on public property, including public streets,
 sidewalks, rights-of-way and parks.
(2)
Authorization of vendors.
The permit holder of a special event shall have sole responsibility and authority
 to allow or disallow sidewalk or street vending as a component of an event and to
 designate the location and activities of such vendors. It shall be unlawful for any
 vendor to engage in such business on private property or at any location or in any
 manner not authorized by the permit holder of the event.

 display on his or her person a badge identifying the vendor as an authorized participant
 in the event. Such identification shall be not less than three inches by three inches,

Title.
This article shall be known and may be referred to as the ""Rockdale County Telecommunications
 Ordinance.""
(b)
Authority.
This article is enacted pursuant to Rockdale County's exclusive zoning and planning
 authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited
 to article 9, section 2, paragraph 4, and article 9, section 2, paragraph 3, as well
 as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but
 not limited to
O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3
, as well as the general police powers of Rockdale County and other authority provided
 by federal, state and local laws applicable hereto.
(c)
Findings, purpose, and intent.
Rockdale County finds that the number, height, design, characteristics and location
 of telecommunications towers and antennas in the county directly affect the public
 health, safety and general welfare. The county finds that such structures have substantially
 increased in number in the county, and are likely to continue to do so in the future.
 The county further finds that such structures, when inappropriately located, have
 the potential to pose a danger to surrounding property owners and the general public,
 and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the county. The county
 finds that there is substantial need directly related to the public health, safety
 and welfare to comprehensively address those concerns through the adoption of the
 following regulations. These regulations are designed and intended to balance the
 interests of residents of Rockdale County, telecommunication providers and telecommunication
 customers in the siting of telecommunication facilities in Rockdale County so as to
 protect the public health, safety and welfare and the integrity and character of residential
 neighborhoods and to foster, through appropriate land use controls, a competitive
 environment for telecommunication carriers without prohibiting the provision of personal
 wireless services or unreasonably discriminating among providers of functionally equivalent
 personal wireless services. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of Rockdale
 County in enacting this article are as follows:
(1)
Avoid locating telecommunication facilities in residential areas whenever possible.
(2)
Encourage the location of towers in appropriate nonresidential areas.
(3)
Protect Rockdale County's built and natural environment by promoting compatible location
 and design standards for telecommunication facilities.
(4)
Encourage placement of telecommunication facilities in areas where the adverse impact
 on the community is minimal.
(5)
Maximize the co-location of services on new and existing towers so as to minimize
 the need for new towers and reduce the total number of towers.
(6)
Encourage use of alternate telecommunication technologies as a primary option rather
 than construction of additional single-use towers.
(7)
Minimize adverse visual effects of telecommunication facilities through careful design,
 siting, screening, and utilization of innovative technology.
(8)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties and personal injury from tower failure
 and falling ice and debris through engineering, careful siting of telecommunication
 structures, and other requirements.
(9)
Ensure compliance with applicable federal statutes and regulations, including the
 Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended.
(10)
Lessen traffic impacts on surrounding residential areas.
(11)
Further the implementation of the county's comprehensive plan.

 for towers shall provide evidence as to why alternate sites in the CID, NC, C-I, C-2,
 O-I, OBP, M-1 or M-2 zoning districts have not been proposed. If requests by the applicant
 to utilize said alternate sites have been denied, said denials shall be in writing
 and included in the application materials. The county will review with special care
 justifications that rely upon undue expense and/or difficulties in entering into a
 lease agreement. The county shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented
 in favor of them, against a tower's negative impacts at the proposed site and on the
 surrounding area.

 of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but
 not limited to set-back requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements,
 the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers
 may be located on leased parcels within such lots.
(b)
Building codes and safety standards.
To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of
 such a facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained
 in applicable Rockdale County and state building and safety codes for telecommunications
 facilities, as amended from time to time. Towers shall be located in a manner such
 that all ice-fall or debris from the tower or alternative tower structure or guy wires
 will not fall outside the parcel under the ownership or control of the applicant and
 on which the tower is located.
(c)
Regulatory compliance.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations
 of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with
 the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations
 are changed, to the extent required by any such regulations, then the owners of the
 telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications
 facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the
 date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
(d)
Security.
All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing
 device or other similar protective device(s) to prevent unauthorized access to the
 telecommunications facility. All towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not
 less than six feet in height.
(e)
Lighting.
No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by
 the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction. If lighting
 is required, it shall be to the minimum applicable standard and shall be shielded
 and/or designed so as to minimize disturbance to surrounding areas.
(f)
Advertising.
No signs shall be permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required to be
 posted by the FCC or FAA. Antennas added to existing structures containing signs shall
 not be construed as violations of this provision.
(g)
Visual impact.
(1)
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
 subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state
 agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing
 structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated
 electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a color that is identical to, or closely
 compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and
 related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(3)
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below
 or incorporated into horizontal or vertical design elements of a building to help
 in camouflaging.
(4)
The design of the buildings and related structures at a telecommunications facility
 site shall, to the maximum extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening
 and landscaping that will blend the telecommunication facilities to the existing natural
 setting and built environment.
(5)
Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be either below grade or screened from public
 view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding
 backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(h)
Landscaping.
(1)
Landscaping shall be provided that effectively screens the view of the equipment shelters
 or cabinets from adjacent uses to a planted height of at least six feet and in a manner
 that effectively reduces visual obtrusiveness of the site. The standard buffer shall
 consist of a landscape strip at least ten feet wide outside the required fence. All
 landscaping shall be reviewed and approved by the county arborist for compliance with
 all county landscaping and tree regulations prior to the issuance of any certificate
 of occupancy (CO). If there is no county arborist, then the director shall designate
 the appropriate person to review said regulations. All landscaping shall be maintained
 for the duration of the facility.
(2)
Existing trees and vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent
 possible. The applicant shall provide a landscaping plan showing existing trees and
 vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost, in
 order to meet the requirements of this section.
(3)
In locations where the strict application of this landscaping requirement would not
 result in the minimization of visual impact, as determined by the department, the
 department may modify or waive this requirement in a manner that is at least equally
 protective of the visual impact of the tower on adjacent and surrounding properties.
(i)
Accessory uses.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall
 be allowed but not used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile
 or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility
 shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
(j)
Set backs.
Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be set back a distance equal to the
 total height of the tower from any adjacent property line and all public rights-of-way,
 measured radially from the base of the tower. In addition, all telecommunication facilities,
 including towers, guy wires and accessory facilities, shall meet the set back and
 other development standards specified for the applicable zoning district.
(k)
Site integration.
Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding
 buildings and land uses. Towers and alternative tower structures shall be integrated
 through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site.
(l)
Multiple towers.
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all set back,
 design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located
 as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics
 of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one
 fails. The clustering of new towers on the same parcel near existing telecommunications
 facilities is encouraged in situations in which the other requirements of this article
 IV are met.
(m)
Historic areas.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be sited where they will negatively affect
 historic properties or scenic view corridors identified by the governing authority
 or any state or federal law or agency.
(n)
Co-location design.
Any tower proposed for a height of between 80 and 100 feet shall be designed and
 intended to accommodate two users. Any tower proposed at a height greater than 100
 feet and up to 150 feet shall be designed and intended to accommodate at least three
 users. Any tower proposed for a height of over 150 feet shall be designed and intended
 to accommodate at least four users.
(o)
Removal requirements.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall
 be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same
 within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner
 of such abandonment.
(p)
Conditions.
In granting administrative or special use permit authorization pursuant to this article
 IV, conditions may be imposed to minimize or ameliorate any negative impacts or effects
 of the proposed telecommunications facility on adjacent properties.
(q)
Annual reports.
The owners of all telecommunications facilities operated within Rockdale County shall
 file an annual report with the Rockdale County Tax Assessor's Office. Said report
 shall be filed on or before the 31st day of December each year, and shall include
 the following:
(1)
Certification that the telecommunications facility is currently in use, and if not
 in use, the date the telecommunications facility ceased being in use.
(2)
A report from a licensed professional engineer or other qualified industry expert
 that the facility structure meets or exceeds all relevant federal or state requirements.
(3)
A report by a radio frequency engineer or other appropriate industry expert that the
 facility is in compliance with current FCC radio emission standards as well as the
 terms of their federal license.
(4)
An updated, current inventory of the owner's existing telecommunication facility sites
 within Rockdale County.

(a)
Legislative findings; purpose and intent.
(1)
The board of commissioners finds that Big Haynes Creek was identified as a feasible
 water source for Rockdale County in a regional water supply plan adopted by the Atlanta
 Regional Commission (ARC) in 1976. The ARC plan was preceded by a number of other
 studies that supported an impoundment on Big Haynes Creek. Consistent with these plans
 and studies, and the county's comprehensive plan, the county first enacted the W-P
 zoning district regulations and determined that the W-P zoning regulations were needed
 in the drainage basin contributing to the Upper Big Haynes Creek in 1981 to protect
 the watershed. These watershed protection zoning regulations require an average lot
 size of three acres (minimum two acres), among other restrictions, to protect the
 environmental and aesthetic qualities of this district and to protect the watershed
 from future environmental degradation.
The board of commissioners further find that in 1987, the Georgia Environmental Protection
 Division studied the reservoir and the Conyers-Rockdale Big Haynes Creek Impoundment
 Authority was created by the Georgia General Assembly and charged with constructing
 a surface water impoundment for a water supply for Rockdale County. In 1988, the Atlanta
 Regional Commission adopted a regional water supply plan that identified the Big Haynes
 project. The ARC has repeatedly warned that the region will not be able to meet its
 water supply demands unless local and regional water supplies are developed. In addition,
 one of the critical issues identified by the Governor's Growth Strategies Commission
 was the importance of expanding Georgia's water supply base. The Big Haynes Authority
 consulted with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Georgia Environmental
 Protection Division, the U.S. Wildlife Federation, the Georgia Conservancy, the U.S.
 Fish and Wildlife Federation and numerous other agencies. The authority held numerous
 public hearings on the project before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued the
 Federal Clean Water Act Section 404 permit in October 1992. To protect this future
 water supply, the Rockdale Board of Commissioners rezoned the remaining portion of
 the reservoir's watershed in 1993, applying the following regulations to said properties
 consistent with this extensive planning for this project. The county finds that these
 W-P regulations, in addition to implementing these studies, will also assist in implementing
 a two-year study, facilitated by ARC, of the 82-square mile watershed which resulted
 in a five-county agreement to control pollution in stormwater that runs off impervious
 surfaces, such as roads, parking lots and rooftops, within the watershed.
The board of commissioners further finds that the W-P zoning regulations are necessary
 to protect water quality for the county's water treatment plant, capable of treating
 22.1 million gallons of water per day (MGD), completed in 2002, enabling Rockdale
 to utilize Randy Poynter Lake for potable water consistent with these W-P regulations.
(2)
The board of commissioners further finds that the county benefits from additional
 public parks and recreational facilities and programs. Consistent with this finding
 the board of commissioners finds that the Randy Poynter Lake (formerly Big Haynes
 reservoir) property may be used for limited recreation purposes in addition to water
 supply purposes consistent with the following regulations and those found in
chapter 62
, article II and the county's comprehensive plan, as amended.
(3)
The board of commissioners finds that it is in the best interests of the citizens
 of the county to establish and protect a reservoir for drinking water and limited
 recreational purposes in this part of the county. The board of commissioners finds
 the Rockdale County Comprehensive Plan adopted July 9, 1991, made certain findings
 and recommendations regarding water quality, wetlands establishment and preservation,
 provision of water supply, establishment and preservation and protection of a watershed
 district, and expansion of public and private recreation uses in the Big Haynes basin.
 Said comprehensive plan has since been amended and updated. The board of commissioners
 incorporates the analyses and findings set out in the Rockdale County Comprehensive
 Plan, as amended, regarding those matters and finds that action to accomplish the
 goals and objectives as set out in the comprehensive plan are implemented in the following
 W-P regulations. The board of commissioners finds that the Rockdale Comprehensive
 Plan requires protection of the Big Haynes Watershed in order to provide optimum conditions
 for the impoundment of the reservoir and the public water intake site. The board of
 commissioners further finds that the Rockdale Comprehensive Plan, as amended, determines
 that the impoundment of the reservoir and the establishment of the watershed protection
 zoning district are necessary actions to protect the integrity of the reservoir and
 intake site, particularly those zoning regulations establishing an average lot size
 of three acres (minimum lot size of two acres), prohibiting commercial and other nonresidential
 uses, and establishing buffers. The board of commissioners finds that the following
 regulations governing the W-P district are consistent with the comprehensive plan
 and will serve to substantially implement the plan.
(4)
The board of commissioners further finds that the watershed protection district as
 recommended in the comprehensive plan, as amended, will allow for protection of wetlands
 and the preservation of the integrity of water supplies to the greatest extent possible.
 The state Department of Natural Resources ""Environmental Planning Criteria for Water
 Supply Watersheds"" defines Big Haynes Creek as a ""small"" water supply watershed. The
 state Department of Natural Resources' criteria require, among other things, streamside
 and lakeside vegetated buffers, impervious surface setbacks, and septic tank and drain
 field setbacks, and that impervious surface be limited throughout the entire watershed
 to a maximum of 25 percent of the area. As a result of the Atlanta Regional Commission
 cooperative watershed study, and other studies, the necessary limitation for impervious
 surface throughout the entire W-P district is at least ten percent of the total area.
(5)
The following regulations are intended to protect the health, safety and general welfare
 of the citizens of the county and to implement the policies and objectives and findings
 of the comprehensive plan, as amended, through the enactment of regulations governing
 the use of the affected land pursuant to the county's zoning, planning and general
 police powers. The purpose of the watershed protection zoning district is to protect
 the public health by setting standards for land use which will maintain, and where
 possible improve the purity of water in the streams in the county that flow into the
 public water intake and reservoir. The W-P district is intended to provide for low
 density residential development, public and private open space, park land, and related
 uses that are compatible with the primary purpose of protecting the purity of the
 water and that are substantially related to the primary intended land use of low-density
 residential development and limited recreational uses.
(b)

(d)
Watershed subzones delineated.
The watershed protection (W-P) district has distinct land areas that require separate
 regulations. Accordingly, there are hereby created within the W-P district the following
 five subzones:
(1)
Watershed/nonreservoir area (W-NR).
(2)
Watershed/reservoir water area (W-RW).
(3)
Watershed/reservoir recreation area (W-RR).
(4)
Watershed/reservoir buffer area (W-RB).
(5)
Watershed/reservoir prohibited area (W-RP).
These five subzones shall be delineated as specified on the official zoning map and
 made a part of this section. Uses permitted within each subzone shall be as specified
 in the table of permitted uses. All other regulations set forth in this section shall
 apply to all subzones unless otherwise stated. The following further describes each
 subzone area:
(1)
W-NR: Watershed/non-reservoir area.
The watershed/non-reservoir area subzone comprises the watershed area within the
 boundaries of the county as defined in the comprehensive plan. This area comprises
 all land outside the reservoir water area, the reservoir buffer area, the reservoir
 recreation area and the reservoir prohibited areas.
(2)
W-RW: Watershed/reservoir water area.
The watershed/reservoir water area subzone comprises the entire area of the water
 impoundment owned in fee simple by the county.
(3)
W-RR: Watershed/reservoir recreation area.
The watershed/reservoir recreation area subzone comprises the areas suitable for
 recreational uses. This subzone comprises governmentally owned land both within and
 outside the normal pool of the reservoir. The portion of the recreation area subzone
 lying outside the normal pool area comprises approximately 25 percent of the reservoir
 shoreline and is subject to the Big Haynes Reservoir Management Ordinance as found
 in article II of
chapter 62
.

(5)
W-RP: Watershed/reservoir prohibited area.
The watershed/reservoir prohibited area subzone is comprised of those areas associated
 with the reservoir that are established for the protection of project operations and
 ecosystems and to provide for the physical safety of the recreational visitor. This
 subzone comprises approximately one percent of the reservoir shoreline.
(e)
Permitted uses.
The table of permitted uses sets forth the uses permitted in each subzone of the
 watershed protection zoning district. Any use not expressly permitted in such table
 is prohibited. Uses or accessory uses which generate or utilize hazardous or toxic
 waste are prohibited.
(f)
Nonconforming uses.
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), all nonconforming situations shall
 be regulated pursuant to
chapter 234
of the UDO.
(g)
Nonconforming retail uses.
(1)
Findings.
The board of commissioners finds that four nonconforming community store uses were
 in existence in the W-P district prior to the enactment of the watershed protection
 zoning district. The board of commissioners finds that the necessity for stringent
 environmental and water quality regulations in the district must be carefully balanced
 with the individual hardships associated with restrictions on these nonconforming
 uses as well as the public interest served by continuing to provide existing general
 store/retail services to residents and visitors in the district. Accordingly, the
 board of commissioners finds that with regard to these existing nonconforming W-P
 country store uses, limited expansion may be authorized, but only in strict accordance
 with the standards and criteria set forth in subsection (g)(2). It is the specific
 intent of this subsection (g) to prohibit any new nonresidential use or structure
 not specifically authorized herein, including but not limited to restaurants, convenience
 stores, gasoline sales, and other retail establishments.
(2)
Criteria.

(a)
Purpose and intent.
(1)
Intent.
The CRS zoning classification is intended to implement the policies of the board
 of commissioners adopted in the Rockdale County Comprehensive Plan. In particular,
 the CRS zoning classification is intended to allow and encourage the form of single-family
 detached residential development intended for the conservation residential category
 of the comprehensive plan future land use map. The CRS zoning classification should
 be utilized in areas where sensitive natural resources are to be preserved.
(2)
Purpose.
The purpose of the CRS zoning classification is:
a.
To create a distinct physical single-family detached residential neighborhood while
 preserving conservation space and valuable view sheds in perpetuity that include sensitive
 natural resources such as streams, creeks, lakes, groundwater, floodplains, wetlands,
 steep slopes, woodlands, exceptional trees, and wildlife habitat.
b.
To ensure that interconnected wildlife corridors, green space, multi-modal trails
 and other dedicated conservation space are protected and accessible in perpetuity
 for various public and private uses.
c.
To encourage the protection of passive outdoor recreation, water quality and non-motorized
 mobility.
d.
To permit grouping of permitted principal and accessory structures on less environmentally
 sensitive areas that will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including impervious
 surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential development.
e.
To minimize stormwater runoff, erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance
 and removal of mature trees and vegetation in residential development.
f.
To encourage design flexibility for innovative development projects that set high
 standards for landscaping, green space, community design and public amenities.
g.
To create a sense of place that is attractive, walkable and environmentally responsible,
 by promoting landscaped walking trails, bike paths, and public gathering places, within
 and outside the subdivision.
h.
To connect the neighborhood with communities, businesses and facilities to reduce
 reliance on automobiles and encourage community interaction.
i.
To encourage reduction of traffic speeds in subdivisions and to reduce the reliance
 on main corridors through the use of connectivity in street design.
(b)
General regulations.

 square feet identified as part of a site analysis conducted by a registered engineer,
 land surveyor or landscape architect and calculated using topographic maps from the
 Rockdale County GIS system or from a topographic survey prepared by a licensed land
 surveyor.
i.
Rock outcroppings.
(2)
Secondary conservation areas.
Secondary conservation areas consist of undeveloped but buildable land and protected
 lands and may be counted as conservation space. Secondary conservation areas, as defined
 by this section, should be protected to the maximum extent feasible, and should include
 the following:
a.
Mature hardwood forests of at least one acre of contiguous area.
b.
Historic and /or archaeological sites.
c.
Passive recreation areas, public and private, to include parks as identified by the
 parks and recreation master plan, open fields, and playgrounds. Impervious surfaces
 within passive recreation areas shall not be credited toward conservation space.
d.
Existing trails that connect the tract to neighboring areas.
e.
Aquifer recharge areas identified in the Rockdale County Comprehensive Plan.
f.
Scenic view sheds, particularly those that can be seen from public roads.
g.
Wetland and stream bank mitigation projects.
h.
Greens, commons, squares, and parks.
In order to provide for terminal vistas and loop roads in lieu of cul-de-sacs, and
 for the enjoyment of the residents, Rockdale County recommends that ten percent of
 the minimum required conservation space land consist of multiple greens, commons,
 squares, or parks, but these smaller areas of conservation space shall not exceed
 20 percent of the total required conservation space.
i.
Street rights-of-way may traverse, but shall not count toward the minimum required
 area of conservation space.
(3)
Outdoor recreation area.
Impervious surfaces in recreation areas shall not be counted as conservation space.
 Lakes and ponds are allowed in outdoor recreation areas, but their surface area shall
 not be counted as conservation space. This category includes: greenways, trails, bikeways,
 paths, tennis courts, ball fields, playfields, courts, golf courses, swimming pools,
 clubhouses, lockers, bicycle facilities, beaches, docks, seating areas, amphitheaters,
 stages, band shells, community buildings, fountains, plazas, patios, decks, lawns,
 picnic shelters and picnic areas, landscaping and other land containing outdoor recreation
 structures and facilities.
(4)
Exclusions.
Excluded from counting toward the minimum amount of conservation space are the following
 (also see the definition of primary conservation space):
a.
Proposed permanent lakes that may be used for wet detention.
b.
Recreation area improvements. Impervious surfaces in recreational areas shall not
 be credited.
c.
Easements.
d.
Up to 50 percent of land area within utility easements, such as but not limited to
 power, gas pipeline easements, sewer line easements, may be counted towards conservation
 space requirements.
e.
Residential yards.
f.
Land that has been or is to be conveyed to a public agency via an agreement for such
 uses as schools, parks, or other public facilities.
(g)
Accessibility of conservation space.

 of all users of the CRS zoned property. Conservation space shall be within 1,000 feet
 of all occupied buildings in the development. If the conservation space is for public
 use, connection shall be made to the conservation space by improved pathways or sidewalks.
(h)
Ownership of conservation space.
The applicant must identify the owner who is responsible for maintaining the conservation
 space, the required buffers and facilities located thereon as the owners of the various
 lots and undeveloped phases located in the subdivision. The above-mentioned property
 shall be considered commons area for the subdivision and the ownership and value of
 such commons area shall reside with the owners of the individual lots and undeveloped
 phases located in the subdivision. The ownership shall be fee simple with undivided
 interest. All deeds recorded for this subdivision shall indicate such ownership in
 the commons area. This ordinance will not require the public dedication of any conservation
 space to any governmental body or agency, nor will it require that public access be
 granted. All conservation land may remain in private hands, or if accepted, be dedicated
 to Rockdale County or a land bank conservation tax-exempt trust that has been approved
 by the Rockdale County Board of Commissioners. The owners may form a property owners
 association for the purpose of managing and maintaining the grounds and any facilities.
 The property owners association shall have lien authority to ensure the collection
 of dues from all members in order to pay for such maintenance.
(i)
Conservation space and common facilities management plan.
The applicant shall submit a conservation space management plan (management plan)
 at the time the construction plans are submitted. The management plan shall be submitted
 and approved prior to the issuance of any land disturbance permit for any development

(a)
Purpose and intent.
(1)
Intent.
The CSO zoning classification is intended to allow and encourage flexibility of design
 of single-family detached residential development in the medium density residential
 and conservation subdivision categories of the comprehensive plan future land use
 map.
(2)
Purpose.
a.
To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order
 to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
b.
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater,
 floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
c.
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
d.
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils,
 which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility
 easements, necessary for residential development.
e.
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of
 vegetation in residential development.
f.
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
g.
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them
 closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks
 and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
h.
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
i.
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both
 within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities
 to reduce reliance on automobiles.
j.
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of
 houses with direct access to and views of open space.
k.
To protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity.
(b)
General regulations.
(1)
Applicability of regulations.
This conservation subdivision ordinance zoning district is available only within
 the medium density residential and conservation subdivision land use categories as
 designated on the Rockdale County Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map.
(2)
Timber harvesting.
The CSO zoning classification shall not be used on property that has been timber
 harvested within 36 months.
(3)
Ownership of development site.
The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single ownership or in multiple
 ownerships. If held in multiple ownerships, however, the site shall be developed according
 to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
(4)
Housing density determination.
The maximum number of lots in the CSO zoning district shall be determined by either
 of the following two methods:
a.
Calculation method:
The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the gross area of the tract
 of land by the minimum lot size specified in the R-1 zoning district regulations.
 In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area
 of the parcel:
1.
Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;

4.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean
 Water Act; and
5.
Anticipated right-of-way needs for roads and utilities.
b.
Yield method:
The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared
 by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to
 yield the highest number of lots possible in the R-1 zoning district regulations.
 The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the
 design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable
 regulations.
(c)
